# m3 (Monetized Module Marketplace)

Objectives:
* maintain the advantages of free open source software
* provide repository owners advanced licensing controls to monetize their work 

Software monetization is essential for success.  In my opinion, this is the primary limitation of open source software, and the only reason why proprietary software still exists.  

Most open source projects lack the funding to really take off.  Most closed source projects lack the community of contributors like open source projects. 

I see a future with the best of both:
* advanced licensing control of the module/api
* advanced source code access control (via encryption)

Repository owners would be able to retire early.  They would be able to allow their 

In the future, we'll have the best of both.  Repository owners need sophisticated controls over their code, how they license it, etc.

How can you monetize open source software?  There's the old viral license trap.

In an effort to create the ultimate operating system, we need a package manager with strong versioning (think `git` and `npm`).  But it needs to be monetized.  The best way to monetize granular packages is to create a licensing strategy.

The goal is to make software *nearly* open-source (free), so that the cost is NOT prohibitive, even at scale.  For example, you pay nothing unless you're charging money.  And you pay
