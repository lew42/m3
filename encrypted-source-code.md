# Encrypting Source Code

The most immediate problem with monetizing open source code, is the most obvious:  the code is public.  Why would anyone pay for something that they can freely copy and paste?

## The Honor System

I feel like most legitimate companies would obey licensing requirements, even if they don't physically have to.  Sublime Text is an interesting example - they offer an unlimited free trial, but they ask you to pay $70.  I wonder how many people actually pay up.

## Encrypting the code

Let's say your framework/operating system had source code protection built in.  You could allow companies to use your modules without being able to see your code.

For example, let's say you discover a *secret formula*.  It would be trivial to reimplement, if someone could see the code.  With today's system of git/npm, you'd have little hope of monetizing 3 lines of code.

However, if you could protect the secret formula, and that formula was valuable to others, you might be able to reap a small fortune.
