# Advanced API Licensing/Control

Let's say your module has several levels of functionality you would like to license at various levels:

* Free Tier
* Premium Tier
* Enterprise Tier

Many services do this.

I can imagine developers might want fine-grained control with regards to their features:
* Allow users to try some premium features N times, or for X days.
* Allow users to use a feature with some limitations.

Many of these concepts are similar to the User permissions system that is baked into file systems (read/write access), or the User Roles/Permissions system in WordPress.
